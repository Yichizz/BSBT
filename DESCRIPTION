Description: An implementation of the Bayesian Spatial Bradley--Terry (BSBT) model. It can be used to investigate data sets where judges compared different spatial areas. It constructs a network to describe how the areas are connected, and then places a correlated prior distribution on the quality parameter for each area, based on the network. The package includes MCMC algorithms to estimate the quality parameters.
