# BTUN: Bradley--Terry for Urban Networks

This package fits the BTUN model to comparative judgement data. It can be used when comparing different urban areas based on the level of deprivation in each area, and it infers the how deprived each area it. It uses a Gaussian Process to model the spatial structure in the variation of deprivation. The package includes an MCMC algorithm to learn the model parameters.
